# HERO: A Memory-Efficient and Fast Structured Low-Rank Reconstruction Algorithm for Accelerated Hypercomplex NMR

**HERO** (a **H**ankel-based **E**fficient **R**econstructions with **O**ptimization) is a fast and memory-saving structured low-rank algorithm for reconstructing hypercomplex NMR spectra. 

**This code is attached for the review of our related manuscript. We kindly request that it not be distributed or shared publicly until the paper is officially published.**

# Instructions

Run the script "test_2DNUS_simulated_slice.m" to reconstruct the synthetic data using different algorithms (SVD, MF, HERO).



# Experimental Data

The experimental data reconstruction demo is not uploaded here due to the redistribution issue of experimental data. However, we believe that the simulated data experiments clearly demonstrate and validate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Interested users can download the data from the original BMRB data library (see below) and use the simulated data reconstruction demo as a reference.
